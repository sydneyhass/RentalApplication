# Rental Application
This application is meant to be a simple command line interface for a Tinder-like rental application. Users can "Swipe Right" for properties that they like and "Swipe Left" on properties that they don't like. 

Liked properties will be added to the Favourites List and disliked properties will be deleted.

## Main

- Help (h)
- List Properties (a)
- Switch to the Favourites List (f)
- Switch to the Default List (d)
- 'Swipe Left' (l)
- 'Swipe Right' (r)
- Skip (n)
- Sort by Address (sa)
- Sort by Number of Rooms (sn)
- Sort by Rent (sr)
- Sort by Distance (sd)
- Quit (q)
